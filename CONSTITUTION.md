## INHERITED FROM Helix Constitution

This module is a submodule of a Helix-family project (e.g.
HelixCode, HelixAgent, ATMOSphere) that includes the Helix
Constitution submodule at the parent's `constitution/` path. All
rules in `constitution/CLAUDE.md` and the
`constitution/Constitution.md` it references (universal anti-bluff
covenant §11.4, no-guessing mandate §11.4.6, credentials-handling
mandate §11.4.10, host-session safety §12, data safety §9, mutation-
paired gates §1.1) apply unconditionally to every change landed here.
The module-specific rules below extend them — they never weaken any
universal clause.

When this file disagrees with the constitution submodule, the
constitution wins. Locate the constitution submodule from any
arbitrary nested depth using its `find_constitution.sh` helper.

# Models — Constitution

> **Status:** Active. This document is the project's authoritative
> rule set. When a rule here conflicts with `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
> or any guide, the Constitution wins.

## Mission

See README.md.

## Mandatory Standards

1. **Reproducibility:** every change is reproducible from a clean
   clone (`git clone <repo> && <project bootstrap>`); no hidden steps.
2. **Tests track behavior, not code:** test what the user-visible
   behavior is, not what the implementation looks like.
3. **No silent skips, no silent mocks above unit tests.**
4. **Conventional Commits** for all commits.
5. **SSH-only for git operations** (`git@…`); HTTPS prohibited.

## Numbered Rules

<!-- Rules are numbered CONST-NNN. New rules append. Removed rules
     keep their number with a "**Retired:** …" line. -->

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

### CONST-033 — Host Power Management is Forbidden

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable. Applies to every project,
submodule, container entry point, build script, test, challenge, and
systemd unit shipped from this repository.

**Rule:** No code in this repository may invoke a host-level power-
state transition (suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-
hibernate, poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec) on the host machine. This
includes — but is not limited to:

- `systemctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}`
- `loginctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}`
- `pm-{suspend,hibernate,suspend-hybrid}`
- `shutdown {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to any value other than `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

**Why:** The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI-agent and
container workloads. On 2026-04-26 18:23:43 the host was auto-
suspended by the GDM greeter's idle policy mid-session, killing
HelixAgent and 41 dependent services. Recurring memory-pressure
SIGKILLs of `user@1000.service` (perceived as "logged out") have the
same outcome. Auto-suspend, hibernate, and any power-state transition
are unsafe for this host.

**Defence in depth (mandatory artifacts in every project):**
1. `scripts/host-power-management/install-host-suspend-guard.sh` —
   privileged installer, manual prereq, run once per host with sudo.
   Masks `sleep.target`, `suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`,
   `hybrid-sleep.target`; writes `AllowSuspend=no` drop-in; sets
   logind `IdleAction=ignore` and `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`.
2. `scripts/host-power-management/user_session_no_suspend_bootstrap.sh` —
   per-user, no-sudo defensive layer. Idempotent. Safe to source from
   `start.sh` / `setup.sh` / `bootstrap.sh`.
3. `scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` —
   static scanner. Exits non-zero on any forbidden invocation.
4. `challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` — asserts
   the running host's state matches layer-1 masking.
5. `challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` — wraps the
   scanner as a challenge that runs in CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Enforcement:** Every project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`
equivalent MUST run both challenges (host state + source tree). A
violation in either channel blocks merge. Adding files to the
scanner's `EXCLUDE_PATHS` requires an explicit justification comment
identifying the non-host context.

**See also:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` for full background and
runbook.

<!-- END host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## Definition of Done

A change is done when:

1. The code change is committed.
2. All project-level tests pass on a clean clone.
3. All challenges in `challenges/scripts/` pass on the running host.
4. Governance docs (`CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) are
   coherent with the change.

<!-- CONST-035 anti-bluff addendum (cascaded) -->

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.


## Article XI §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor (verbatim user mandate)

> Verbatim user mandate: *"We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"*
>
> Operative rule: **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive runtime evidence captured during execution. Metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are critical defects regardless of how green the summary line looks. No false-success results are tolerable.

**Cascade requirement:** this anchor (verbatim quote + operative rule) MUST appear in every owned-by-us submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`. Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Tests AND Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — a Challenge that scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of defect as a unit test that does. Both must produce positive end-user evidence.

## CONST-047 — Recursive Submodule Application Mandate (cascaded from root CONSTITUTION.md)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-14): *"Make sure all work we do is applied ALWAYS to all Submodules we control under our organizations (vasic-digital and HelixDevelopment) fully recursively everywhere with full bluff-proofing and comprehensive documentation, user manuals and guides and full tests and Challenges coverage!"*

Every engineering deliverable produced for the main project MUST be applied — fully and recursively — to every owned submodule under the `vasic-digital` and `HelixDevelopment` GitHub organizations. Each owned submodule (including this one) MUST receive in lockstep: (1) anti-bluff posture (CONST-035 / Article XI §11.9), (2) comprehensive documentation matching actual capabilities, (3) full tests + Challenges coverage with captured runtime evidence, (4) recursive propagation through nested submodules under the same orgs, (5) synchronized commits when meta-repo state advances this surface.

See the root `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-047 for the full mandate. This anchor MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md.
---

## CONST-048: Full-Automation-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.25)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Make sure that every feature, every functionality, every flow, every use case, every edge case, every service or application, on every platform we support is covered with full automation tests which will confirm anti-bluff policy and provide the proof of fully working capabilities, working implementation as expected, no issues, no bugs, fully documented, tests covered! Nothing less than this does not give us a chance to deliver stable product! This is mandatory constraint which MUST BE respected without ignoring, skipping, slacking or forgetting it!"*

No feature / functionality / flow / use case / edge case / service / application on any supported platform of this submodule is deliverable until covered by automation tests proving six invariants: (1) anti-bluff posture with captured runtime evidence (CONST-035); (2) proof of working capability end-to-end on target topology; (3) implementation matching documented promise; (4) no open issues/bugs surfaced; (5) full documentation in sync; (6) four-layer test floor (pre-build + post-build + runtime + paired mutation).

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-048 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-048 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.25 for the full mandate.
## CONST-049: Constitution-Submodule Update Workflow Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.26)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every time we add something into our root (constitution Submodule) Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD we MUST FIRST fetch and pull all new changes / work from constitution Submodule first! All changes we apply MUST BE commited and pushed to all constitution Submodule upstreams! In case of conflict, IT MUST BE carefully resolved! Nothing can be broken, made faulty, corrupted or unusable! After merging full validation and verification MUST BE done!"*

Before ANY modification to `constitution/{Constitution,CLAUDE,AGENTS}.md` in the parent project, the agent or operator MUST execute the 7-step pipeline: (1) fetch + pull first inside the constitution submodule worktree; (2) apply the change with §11.4.17 classification + verbatim mandate quote; (3) validate (meta-test + no merge-conflict markers + cross-file consistency); (4) commit + push to EVERY configured upstream of the constitution submodule (governance files only — never `git add -A`); (5) careful conflict resolution preserving union of governance content (force-push forbidden per CONST-043 / §9.2); (6) post-merge `git submodule update --remote --init` + re-run cascade verifier (CONST-047); (7) bump consuming project's `.gitmodules` pointer to the new constitution HEAD in the SAME commit as cascade work.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-049 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-049 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.26 for the full mandate.
## CONST-050: No-Fakes-Beyond-Unit-Tests + 100%-Test-Type-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.27)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Mocks, stubs, placeholders, TODOs or FIXMEs are allowed to exist ONLY in Unit tests! All other test types MUST interract with real fully implemented System! No fakes, empty implementations or bluffing is allowed of any kind! All codebase of the project MUST BE 100% covered with every supported test type: unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests, full automation tests, security tests, ddos tests, scaling tests, chaos tests, stress tests, performance tests, benchmarking tests, ui tests, ux tests, Challenges (fully incorporating our Challenges Submodule — https://github.com/vasic-digital/Challenges). EVERYTHING MUST BE tested using HelixQA (fully incorporating HelixQA Submodule — https://github.com/HelixDevelopment/HelixQA). HelixQA MUST BE used with all possible written tests suites (test banks) for every applications, service, platform, etc and execution of the full HelixQA QA autonomous sessions! All required dependency Submodules MUST BE added into the project as well (fully recursive!!!)."*

Two cooperating invariants:

**(A) No-fakes-beyond-unit-tests.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholders, `TODO`, `FIXME`, "for now", "in production this would", or empty-implementation patterns are PERMITTED only in unit-test sources. Every other test type — integration, E2E, full automation, security, DDoS, scaling, chaos, stress, performance, benchmarking, UI, UX, Challenges, HelixQA — MUST exercise this submodule's real, fully implemented system against real infrastructure. Production code MUST NOT import mock paths.

**(B) 100% test-type coverage.** Codebase MUST be covered by every supported test type the domain warrants: unit, integration, E2E, full-automation, security, DDoS, scaling, chaos, stress, performance, benchmarking, UI, UX, Challenges (vasic-digital/Challenges submodule fully incorporated), HelixQA (HelixDevelopment/HelixQA submodule fully incorporated, with full autonomous QA sessions executing every registered test bank with captured wire evidence).

**Required dependency submodules** (recursive per CONST-047): Challenges + HelixQA + any other functionality submodules under vasic-digital/HelixDevelopment orgs this submodule depends on.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-050 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-050 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.27 for the full mandate.
## CONST-051: Submodules-As-Equal-Codebase + Decoupling + Dependency-Layout Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.28)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"All existing Submodules in the project that we are controlling and belong to some our organizations (vasic-digital, HelixDevelopment, red-elf, ATMOSphere1234321, Bear-Suite, BoatOS123456, Helix-Flow, Helix-Track, Server-Factory - we can ALWAYS check dynamically using GitHub and GitLab CLIs) are equal parts of the project's codebase! We MUST work on that code as much as we do with main project's codebase! All on equal basis! Equally important! ... We MUST NEVER modify Submodules to bring into them any project specific context since they all MUST BE ALWAYS fully decoupled, project not-aware, fully reusable and modular (by any other project(s)), completely testable! All Submodule dependencies that are used by Submodule MUST BE acessed from the root of the project! We MUST NOT have nested Submodule dependencies but accessing each from proper location from the root of the project - directly from project's root project_name/submodule_name or some more proper structure project_name/submodules/submodule_name!"*

Three cooperating invariants apply to every owned-by-us submodule (orgs: vasic-digital, HelixDevelopment, red-elf, ATMOSphere1234321, Bear-Suite, BoatOS123456, Helix-Flow, Helix-Track, Server-Factory, plus any subsequently authorised org — discoverable via `gh org list` / `glab`):

**(A) Equal-codebase.** This submodule is an EQUAL part of every consuming project's codebase. The consuming project's engineering practice — analysis, extension, test creation, gap-filling, bug-fix, documentation (user manuals, guides, diagrams, graphs, SQL definitions, website pages, all materials) — applies to this submodule on equal basis. Coverage ledgers (CONST-048) list this submodule as an in-scope target.

**(B) Decoupling / reusability.** This submodule MUST remain fully decoupled from any specific consuming project. NEVER inject project-specific context (hardcoded paths, hostnames, asset names, naming schemes). Stay project-not-aware, reusable, modular, completely testable as a standalone repository. When parent-project info is needed, use configuration injection (env var, config file, constructor parameter) — never a hardcoded reach.

**(C) Dependency-layout.** Any dependency this submodule consumes MUST be accessible from the consuming project's root at `<root>/<name>/` or `<root>/submodules/<name>/`. **Nested own-org submodule chains are FORBIDDEN** — this submodule MUST NOT have its own `.gitmodules` entries pulling in further owned-by-us repos. Third-party submodules are exempt.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-051 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-051 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.28 for the full mandate.
